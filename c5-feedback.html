            <p>Pair programming was one of the things I was looking forward to before attending DBC.  I have always enjoyed working in groups. I find it helps motivate me and focus me on the task at hand.  It’s always less likely that two people get stuck in the dame place so I find the pace usually picks up as well.</p>
<p>I was delighted to discover how true this is in programming.  Programming can be a very frustrating endeavor and a second set of eyes is a godsend.  More than that though I have really enjoyed working with people who are way more or less comfortable than me with the material.  For me the main benefit of pairing has been that it forces me to articulate what I am doing step by step.  Today I learned that I have don’t have a clear idea as to how the #inject enumerable actually works.  I used it in a pair to solve a problem and was quite proud of its elegance.  My pair asked me how it worked because they could not follow it.  I was surprised at the number of places I was unsure of as well.  It can be easy to fall into the trap of just learning patterns without understanding how everything really works.</p>
<h3>Feedback:</h3>
<p>So far my feed back has been mainly positive.  The only negative feedback I’ve gotten was in the first week of the program.  Early on I just think I didn’t know enough to contribute all that much.  I have worked hard to do a lot of work outside of the curriculum and to try to really understand things.  In one of my pairs this week I was asked if I had any previous programming background because I seemed very comfortable with the problem we were working on.  I think in that particular case I just happened to have done another problem that was very similar and fresh in my head but it still made me feel like I am progressing well</p>
<p>In terms of writing feedback, that has been fairly easy for me.  My pairs have all been very productive for me.  The only problem I am having is finding time to schedule them</p>
