<h3>Values: </h3>
<p>Growing up I was rather shy and introverted. On the first day of 7th grade Japanese class, I noticed two students drawing a life-like portrait of an old man on the white board using blue dry erase markers. Later I discovered that the old man was James Joyce, but on that day, I was too shy to ask.  However, I knew that I had never been in a classroom like this.  The teacher was an aspiring cartoonist and writer whose enthusiasm for learning and creating had a way of drawing in like-minded students. </p>
<p>I had been writing stories and drawing since I was very young, and when I spoke to him about making my own comic book, he encouraged me to start a club. While I was excited by the idea, I was also terrified; I directed the first club meeting from the back of the room. However, students kept attending and the club grew, until one year later I was editor-in-chief of the biggest club in school.  I was motivated by fellow club members, and mentored younger students. I had previously spent my free periods alone in the library reading, but now I had a group of peers with whom to share my interests and ideas. I learned the value of community to the learning process, as well as the satisfaction of taking on a leadership role for a long-term project about which I was passionate.  I still consider myself introverted, but have learned how to reach out to other people.   </p>

<h3>Advice:</h3>
<p>One of my friends asked me for advice recently.  He was having trouble at work with a coworker who was unskilled at a particular task.  He had bluntly pointed out his co workers lack of aptitude and his co work became hostile and instead of improving his situation he made it worse.  I advised him to spend more time building rapport with his co worker and to frame the problem less as a lack of competence on his partners side but rather as a more efficient way they could work together</p>
<p>When I think about stereotype threat and my values I can see how it can be threating to get involved in something that one is not traditionally associated with.  I often find that a good way to make someone comfortable being interested in something is to be unselfconsciously interested yourself.</p>
