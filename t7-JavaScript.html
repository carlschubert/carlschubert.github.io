            <h3>Objects in JavaScript </h3>
          </div>

          <div id="text">
            <p>This is my first week working with JavaScript after using almost exclusively ruby.  Many of the concepts feel very familiar and my knowledge of ruby definitely helps learning java but there is one immediately jarring difference.  It is in the way JavaScript handles objects.  Objects in JavaScript are on the surface similar to hashes in ruby.  Here is one example:</p>
<code>var boat ={<br>
name: “Argo”<br>
crew: “Argonauts”</code>
<p> In contrast to Ruby:</p>
<code>boat = Hash.new<br>
boat = {:name => “Argo”<br>
:crew => “Argonauts”}</code>
Although JavaScript objects are superficially similar there is a key difference.  A ruby object is somewhat protected thought data encapsulation and scopes as to what can be accessed.  In JavaScript there is no such restriction on object properties.  For me personally this has allowed for some flexibility but also some truly baffling errors.</p>
