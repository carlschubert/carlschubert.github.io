            <h3>Software Patents </h3>

            <p>A patent grants an inventor a guarantee the he has sole right to sell his invention for a period of time.  The idea behind granting such rights is to reward the research and innovation.  For an idea to be patentable it must be novel, non-obvious, and useful.  In the days of the following the continental congress the secretary of state, the secretary of war, and the attorney general and to receive a patent was a rare reward for a notable achievement. In 1790 three were given out.  In 2013 over <a href='http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/h_counts.htm'>400000 were issued.</a></p>
            <p>What are all these patents and how do they affect development?</p>
            <p>Here are some of my favorites:</p>
            <h4>Amazon's one-click ordering patent</h4>
            <p>This one patents websites remembering your shipping address, credit card details etc so that you don't have to type it again.  Amazon owns the patent for this.   They sued Barnes and Noble for having this feature on their site.</p>
            <h4>Making links in email clickable</h4>
            <p>Even if the sender did not make them clickable.  Apple owns this one and has sued HTC over it.</p>
            <h4>In app purchasing</h4>
            <p>This is patented. Lodsys sued Rovio (maker of Angry Birds) over this.  </p>
            <h4>What makes all of these patents possible?  </h4>
            <p>Well a patent must be novel, non-obvious and useful.  The test for novelty is a literature search.  Which puts it somewhat at odds with the second test.  An obvious idea would likely not be published.  In fact the most prestigious places to publish are likely to filter out the simple and ubiquitous ideas and these are the places first considered by the patent office.</p>
            <p>The problem is once someone gets a patent for an obvious implementation this grants them power to block anyone else from the idea.  When amazon patented one click buying, their implementation was not even reviewed because any version of one click purchasing was solely amazons, even if it is technically different or developed without any knowledge of amazonâ€™s efforts.</p>
            <p>To me there seems to be some steps that can be taken.  Rather than the test of novelty and obviousness be one of literature search, perhaps the patents themselves should be peer reviewed.  Currently the only recourse people have is to fight expensive court battles that all but the biggest companies cant afford.  If patents were open for review and comment before being granted than any ridiculous patents would be notice before they could do any harm.  Exposing patents before they are granted would also incentivize only applying for patents you are sure are robust as any trade secretes contained within would be exposed by review.</p>
