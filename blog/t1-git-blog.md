# Version Control
#### First tech blog post
#### 9/21/14

This is an introduction to Version control. Version control is important in any collaborative project. It ensures that everyone is working on the same document and not making redundant or duplicate changes. Git is a way of implementing version control. If I had to describe git to some one I would liken it to mircosofts track changes in word. Git is a way to work on a copy of an original document while keeping track of what you edit, who edited and why. It also has additional features, like merging changes from different people that would be quite frankly nice to have in word. Not only can it do all that but it also tracks your track changes so you can revert to any previous version of the file.  A very useful feature if like me when your computer tells you there is a conflict you start deleting files.  Once changes are made they can be uploaded to github which works like dropbox or google docs. Your uploaded version then be reviewed and add to the master version on github. Which can then be pull be project members and worked on locally by them.
