# Shereef Fireside

I tuned into the fireside chat at the least comprehensible moment, Right in the middle of shereef extended kitchen metaphor.  I am a huge fan of elaborate and confusing metaphor.  At first I just enjoyed the manic sincerity of it but after awhile it started to make sense.  Iâ€™m not sure how well I will be able to integrate into the social media end of DBC.  I tend to avoid social media and I prefer to share things in a more targeted way.  I still write letters.  I am also excited to try using all of these tools I have been avoiding for so long.  This whole experience for me is about new things.  I am also easily moved by manic sincerity.
