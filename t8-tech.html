              <p>I recently was exposed to a <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">website </a> .  This made me think of a recent conflict I had with a roommate.  We came into conflict because I was very frustrated by his behavior.  He stayed up all night and smoked cigarettes continuously.  When he did sleep it was with the tv on full blast.  When  I confronted him about these problems he would readily agree but not actually modify his behavior.</p>
              <p>Eventually once I learned more about his situation I came to understand that he was just in a very difficult place and It wasnâ€™t that he did not care.  He was just preoccupied.</p>
              <p>In terms of the compass, he had an avoidance direction.  He could not handle what was happening in his life so he avoided it.  I would say I tend in the attack self direction.  I readily blame myself and take responsibly for thing that are not necessarily my fault.  </p>
