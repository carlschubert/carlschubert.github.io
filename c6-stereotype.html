            <h3>Stereotype Threat </h3>
          </div>
          <div id="text">
            <p>Stereotype threat is a term described in <ahref="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/3/">an article by Claude M. Steele</a> that refers to a phenomenon where a person preforms worse on a task because they are anxious about being judged based on their stereotypical aptitude in sort of a self fulfilling prophesy.  Steele observed that black American college students performed worse on a literature test after being reminded of their race when compared to a similar group that were not reminded.  Steele attributed blame to a stereotype about black Americans underperforming in the field.</p>
            <p>Not only can this anxiety cause poor performance, it can also cause underrepresentation.  People will avoid certain lines of work if they feel anxious about being judged.  Even though this article was written more than a decade ago women, and minorities are still underrepresented in many academic fields.  This is especially true in tech and other STEM fields.</p>
            <p>In modern America discrimination is no longer codified in law but I think the phenomenon Steele described is one of the primary ways it has persisted.</p>
