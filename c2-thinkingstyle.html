            <p>After taking an online <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">thinking style test</a> at I generated the graph above.  According to the graph I am about equal parts abstract sequential and concrete random.   About two weeks ago I took this test scored quite differently.  I have some reason to doubt the test-retest reliability of this fifteen question internet quiz perhaps something can be gleaned from it by just reading though the learning types.    I read though the descriptions of various thinking styles and I don&#39t think I am concrete random.  I am not a huge experimenter.  I usually have a clear idea in my head before I start something and I love to iterate.  I do identify more with abstract sequential.  I love breaking down problem and really thinking them though before starting to really work on them.  I also struggle when I am not given enough time to learn something new or given lots of regulations on how I should accomplish a task.  I tend to be very comprehensive and I like to do things my own way.</p>
            <p>I think reading these list of rather discrete and defined characteristic can be interesting but I think personally I believe people are more varied and plastic than could ever be inferred from a multiple choice test.  In fact all testing of this kind is inherently flawed.  What is being measured is very secondary.  As a society we love data collection but often donâ€™t think critically about what we are actually able to infer from what we have gathered.  I tend prefer the reading we have done as part of devboot camp on the growth vs fixed mindset.  A Growth-minded person acknowledges their own limitations and then tries to work mitigate and develop their weakness.  A Fixed-minded person believes their capabilities are immutable and must simply be accepted.
            </p>
            <p>Having reflected on this, I can still acknowledge that I will not always have time to learn at my own pace.  Sometimes done is better than perfect.  Having this blog is not easy for me but I think it is helping me become more structured and disciplined.
