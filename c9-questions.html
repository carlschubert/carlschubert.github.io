              <p> I just read Jon Skeet’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140709094611/http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx">post</a> on asking questions on stack overflow.  He outlines the importance of using the title to frame the question and of providing context to help someone understand the problem.</p>
              <p>When confused it can be difficult to explain exactly where you got lost.  That’s part of the problem.  I personally can have the tendency to be vague out of frustration or to overload the person I am asking with information.  Jon Skeet outlines the importance of giving context in a controlled thoughtful way and to phrase your question in a straight forward way that broadly contains your intent without getting lost in details right away.</p>
              <p>A strategy I often use is to include my best guess along with my question.  I find that this can help to elucidate my thought process to someone and help them figure out where it went wrong.</p>
